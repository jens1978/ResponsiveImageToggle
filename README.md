ResponsiveImageToggle
=====================
Yet its only an idea and an description.

In an mobile document, with certain screen screesizes, it replaces the &lt;img> with &lt;button> Element tags. When pressed &lt;button>, the image will load.

I'm not sure wheter to use jquery or, node.js for development.
  So my path of development will leead me to folowing steps.
  
Phase I
  => Standard Javascript, no frame works required

Phase II
  => jquery enabled
  
Phase II
  => node.js server sided
