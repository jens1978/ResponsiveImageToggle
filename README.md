ResponsiveImageToggle
=====================
Yet its only an idea and an description.

In an mobile document, with certain screen screesizes, it replaces the &lt;img> with
&lt;button> Element tags. When pressed &lt;button>, the image will load.

I'm not sure wheter to use jquery or, node.js for development.
  So my path of development will leead me to folowing steps.
  
  * Phase I
  1. Standard Javascript
  2. works with replacing images on the fly

  * Phase II
  1. jquery enabled
  
  * Phase II
  3. node.js server sided
